# OrthoFlow
## Digitisation and Workflow Automation of Orthodontic Case Records

OrthoFlow is a web-based system designed to digitise orthodontic patient records and automate clinical workflows.  
The platform replaces paper-based documentation with structured digital records, integrates radiographs into patient folders, tracks treatment history, and sends automated appointment reminders — improving efficiency, accessibility, and continuity of care.
